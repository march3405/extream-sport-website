Surfing Adventure

Be ready to go on a moment's notice. We will call you when the surf is pumping and fly you out for five mornings of hurricane inspired summertime south swell.

We provide roundtrip transportation from San Diego, hearty home-style meals, unlimited surfing and instruction. All surfing equipment is provided or you can bring your own.

All levels of ability are welcome ! There are white water ocean views from your balcony and a heated jacuzzi after surfing. You'll get close-up water shots of your surfing action to show the folks back home. Non-surfing significant others welcome, but no whining allowed. This is a surf trip. Go away with the experience of a lifetime!
